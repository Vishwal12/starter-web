Diwali is an important festival for the people of Hindu religion. Everyone waits for this festival with eager in order to get lots of fun and pleasure while lighting candles and clay diyas in the night. We should be conscious of celebrating this festival without any harm to the public as well as environment. We should know that the crackers we burn on diwali is very disadvantageous to the health of people and environment. High pitch sound making crackers are enough to disturb human mind and balance of atmosphere. Some fire-rockets go very high in the sky which create the fear of fire if used in the residential colonies.

So, we should celebrate safe and happy diwali without crackers and other harmful materials in order to keep ourselves healthy and natural cycle in balance. It is the festival of lights and cleanliness, not the festival of firecrackers. It is the festival to worship Goddess Laxmi, not the festival to make anyone sorrow through the fire-rockets.
