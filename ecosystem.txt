The Earth hosts a vast network of ecosystems, from tiny tide pools to broad deserts to polar ice shelves. An ecosystem is defined as the habitat in which animals, plants, and microorganisms interact with non-living factors such as landscapes and temperature. Balanced ecosystems maintain a flow of materials and energy. In a balanced ecosystem, an interdependence of each factor exists. Any waste materials can be used by living animals, plants and other organisms.
